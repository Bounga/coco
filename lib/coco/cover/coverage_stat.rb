  # An "array of lines hit" is an array of integers, possibly nil.
  # Such array is obtain from Coverage.result.

  # Each integer represent the state of a source line:
  # * nil: source line will never be reached (like comments)
  # * 0: source line could be reached, but was not
  # * 1 and above: number of time the source line has been reached
